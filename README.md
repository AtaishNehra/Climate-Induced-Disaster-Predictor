# About

Climate Change has had a great impact on the globe's environment. One of these effects has been the increase of natural disasters. To address this issue, modern neural network architectures were trained on the International Monetary Fund's Climate Change Indicator Datasets [\[1\]](#Acknowledgments) to predict the number of natural disasters that occur in 30 different countries over a 28 year time-span. The models chosen were the Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short Term Memory, and LSTM with Attention.

All architectures were able to estimate the number of natural disasters, 4 years ahead, using climate change data. Results show that commonly known indicators, CO concentrations; surface temperature; end etc, that exhibit climate change does have an impact on the frequency of natural disasters.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

## Installation

_Below is a step-by-step guide to install and setup the prediction models._

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AtaishNehra/Climate-Induced-Disaster-Predictor.git
   ```
2. Install notebook dependencies
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. Install Jupyter GIT Plugin
   ```sh
   pip install --upgrade jupyterlab jupyterlab-git
   ```

# Usage

_To use the repository's notebooks, you can launch the notebooks through Jupyter Notebook or through Jupyter Lab. Ensure that all required packages and software are installed before using the notebooks._

* Launch Jupyter Notebook
   ```sh
   python -m notebook
   ```
* Launch Jupyter Lab
   ```sh
   python -m jupyterlab
   ```
